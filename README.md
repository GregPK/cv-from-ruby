# Personal CV generator

A work in progress.

## Goal

 * Generate a CV in a format that I feel best describes programming skillsets.
 * Allow the CV to be written in a DSL that handles the data
 * Have one central repository for different output formats.

## DSL (not implemented)

 * Everything that should be in the resume data-wise should be able to be defined in two ways:
 ** YAML/JSON file
 ** Simple DSL
